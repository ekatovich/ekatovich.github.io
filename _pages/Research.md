Resource discoveries are often followed by long delays and heterogeneous production realizations. Some discoveries lead to revenue windfalls while others never produce. This uncertainty creates challenges for governance: policymakers may alter present behavior in anticipation of future revenues or struggle to adapt to disappointed expectations. I exploit quasi-experimental subnational variation to estimate causal effects of offshore oil and gas discoveries on local governments in Brazil. Using an original geolocated dataset of 179 major discovery announcements, I estimate dynamic effects of discoveries on municipal public finances, public goods provision, and political competition, selection, and patronage. I develop a forecasting model to document that most municipalities (30 of 48) affected by discoveries ultimately fail to receive the revenues they could have expected. These disappointed municipalities suffer significant declines in per capita investment and public goods spending after ten years. In contrast, municipalities where discoveries are realized enjoy significant growth in per capita revenues and spending, but do not invest in economic diversification or improve real public goods provision. My findings highlight the importance of accounting for timing and heterogeneity in discovery realizations after discovery announcements.<br/>

Are Workers Cursed by Resources? Effects of Oil Boom and Bust on Earnings, Education, and Inequality  <br/> (_with [Dominic Parker](https://aae.wisc.edu/dparker/), and [Steven Poehlekke](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/steven-poelhekke)_)
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
How are workers' careers shaped by exposure to a volatile natural resource sector? Drawing
on employer-employee linked panel data covering the universe of formal workers in Brazil between 2003-
2017, we identify workers who are poached or newly hired into oil-linked sectors (direct, upstream, and
downstream) during periods of oil boom (2006-2013) and bust (2014-2017). Using event studies, we estimate
dynamic eects of exposure to the volatile oil sector on wages, employment, skill formation, and lifetime
formal earnings, relative to (extremely) closely matched counterfactual workers who are poached or newly
hired into other sectors at the same time. Results show that timing of entry into oil matters: workers hired
into oil-linked sectors at the beginning of Brazil's oil boom earn significantly more than matched workers
hired into other sectors; workers hired immediately prior to the bust period suffer significant earnings and
employment penalties. Furthermore, exposure to the oil sector exerts dramatically heterogeneous effects on
workers of differing education levels. High education workers earn more during boom years and are retained
by firms during the bust. Lower education workers never enjoy signifcant gains during the boom and are
laid off by firms during the bust. Exploiting an original complementary dataset on oil-linked graduates
from higher education programs in Brazil, we document that the oil boom period was accompanied by a
boom in oil-linked skill formation, largely driven by growth in private-sector technical training programs.<br/>

Local Politicians, Special Interests, and Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon <br/> (_with [Fanny Moffette](https://fannymoffette.com/)_)
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
When economic incentives to clear land for agriculture run up against centralized efforts to
combat deforestation, do local politicians intercede to promote their own economic interests or those of their
campaign supporters? How does the behavior of local politicians and special interest groups change when
centralized enforcement efforts are relaxed? By combining comprehensive land registries for the Brazilian
Amazon, data on local political candidates and campaign donors in five municipal elections between 2000-
2016, and satellite data on deforestation and land use, we construct an original panel dataset of annual tree
cover loss on properties belonging to political candidates and campaign donors in the Brazilian Amazon
between 2000-2020. Drawing on this dataset, we estimate event studies around close municipal elections
to explore whether landowning candidates increase deforestation on their own properties before or after
winning an election, and whether successful candidates reward landowning donors by allowing them to
deforest more. Our findings inform debates over the decentralization of resource governance, elite capture,
and resource conservation policy.<br/>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Labor productivity is a crucial long-run determinant of real wages. Nonetheless, wage and productivity dynamics often diverge in practice due to a range of economic and institutional factors. This study analyzes the relation between the dynamics of labor productivity and wages in Brazil from 1996 to 2014, and adopts a sectoral perspective to account for divergent trends among economic sectors. Analyses are based on pooled data drawn from the National Accounts and the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios, and hierarchical data models are estimated to assess the impacts of state- and sector-level factors on individuals’ wages. Results indicate that productivity is significantly positively associated with wage levels for all economic sectors, but that institutional factors such as labor formalization and minimum wage exert equally significant impacts, suggesting that wage growth over the 1996-2014 period was as much the result of institutional changes as of transformation of Brazil’s productive structure.<br/>

Are GMO Policies "Trade Related"? Empirical Analysis of Latin America <br/>
[Pamela J. Smith](https://www.apec.umn.edu/people/pamela-smith) and Erik S. Katovich<br/>
Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, Vol. 39, No. 2, pp. 286-312 (2017)<br/>
[[Published Version](https://doi.org/10.1093/aepp/ppw021){:target="_blank"}] <br/>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
This paper empirically examines whether GMO policies are “trade related” for countries in Latin America (LA). First, we use the Balassa index to assess the “revealed comparative advantage” of LA countries. We find that LA countries have a revealed comparative advantage in GMO industries relative to the world, and that intra-regional trade in these industries is modest relative to external trade. Second, we estimate the Gravity model to examine the effects of importers’ GMO policies on Argentina and Brazil’s bilateral exports of soybeans and maize. We find that strong GMO policies in importers have a negative effect on Argentina’s bilateral exports of soybeans (an industry and country with historically high GMO content). Further, we find that past GMO policies are a strong determinant of Argentina’s future bilateral exports, and that the negative trade effects of strong GMO policies are increasing over time. In contrast, we find a weaker relationship between the GMO policies of importers and Brazil’s bilateral exports (consistent with Brazil’s more recent increases in GMO content). These findings for Argentina and Brazil provide a benchmark for other developing countries that are looking for guidance on servicing trading partners with diverse GMO policies.</details> <br/>
