The Presource Curse: Anticipation, Disappointment, and Governance after Oil Discoveries <br/>
[[Working Paper](/files/Katovich_PresourceCurse.pdf){:target="_blank"}] <br/>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Major resource discoveries may cause governments and politicians to alter their behavior
based on expectations of future revenues. Yet discoveries often fail to pan out. Do public spending and political competition increase in anticipation of future
windfalls? Are there long-term consequences of disappointed expectations? I test
for subnational evidence of this “Presource Curse” following a wave of offshore oil
discoveries in Brazil between 2000-2017. I exploit a quasi-experiment created by
Brazil’s formulaic sharing rules for oil and gas revenues, which allow municipal governments
to predict whether they will benefit from exogenous offshore discoveries.
Drawing on an original geolocated dataset of 179 major discovery announcements,
I use event studies to estimate dynamic effects of discoveries on municipal public
finances, public goods provision, political competition, and firm entry and hiring.
To explore the effects of disappointment, I build a model of offshore oil production
and royalty allocation to forecast each municipality’s expected revenue stream after
discovery announcements. I find that disappointment was widespread: 30 of 48
Brazilian municipalities affected by discovery announcements between 2000-2017 ultimately
receive less than 40% of the revenues they could have expected. Further, I
find that municipalities do not exhibit rapid anticipatory responses to discovery announcements,
but ten years after a discovery, municipalities where production met
expectations enjoy significant increases in revenues (+75%) and spending (+21%)
relative to never-treated controls. They do not, however, show improvements in
public goods provision. Disappointed municipalities experience reduced per capita
investment (-57%) and education and health spending (-26%) ten years on, suggesting
these places are worse off than control municipalities that never received a
discovery. Local political competition intensifies after discovery announcements.<br/>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Labor productivity is a crucial long-run determinant of real wages. Nonetheless, wage and productivity dynamics often diverge in practice due to a range of economic and institutional factors. This study analyzes the relation between the dynamics of labor productivity and wages in Brazil from 1996 to 2014, and adopts a sectoral perspective to account for divergent trends among economic sectors. Analyses are based on pooled data drawn from the National Accounts and the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios, and hierarchical data models are estimated to assess the impacts of state- and sector-level factors on individuals’ wages. Results indicate that productivity is significantly positively associated with wage levels for all economic sectors, but that institutional factors such as labor formalization and minimum wage exert equally significant impacts, suggesting that wage growth over the 1996-2014 period was as much the result of institutional changes as of transformation of Brazil’s productive structure.<br/>

Are GMO Policies "Trade Related"? Empirical Analysis of Latin America <br/>
[Pamela J. Smith](https://www.apec.umn.edu/people/pamela-smith) and Erik S. Katovich<br/>
Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, Vol. 39, No. 2, pp. 286-312 (2017)<br/>
[[Published Version](https://doi.org/10.1093/aepp/ppw021){:target="_blank"}] <br/>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
This paper empirically examines whether GMO policies are “trade related” for countries in Latin America (LA). First, we use the Balassa index to assess the “revealed comparative advantage” of LA countries. We find that LA countries have a revealed comparative advantage in GMO industries relative to the world, and that intra-regional trade in these industries is modest relative to external trade. Second, we estimate the Gravity model to examine the effects of importers’ GMO policies on Argentina and Brazil’s bilateral exports of soybeans and maize. We find that strong GMO policies in importers have a negative effect on Argentina’s bilateral exports of soybeans (an industry and country with historically high GMO content). Further, we find that past GMO policies are a strong determinant of Argentina’s future bilateral exports, and that the negative trade effects of strong GMO policies are increasing over time. In contrast, we find a weaker relationship between the GMO policies of importers and Brazil’s bilateral exports (consistent with Brazil’s more recent increases in GMO content). These findings for Argentina and Brazil provide a benchmark for other developing countries that are looking for guidance on servicing trading partners with diverse GMO policies.</details> <br/>
