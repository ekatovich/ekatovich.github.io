Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
<br/>
<br/>

My research focuses on development economics, environmental and resource economics, and political economy. I use econometric and geospatial tools to study institutions of natural resource governance, structural transformation and industrial policies, and the effects of resource booms and energy transitions on governments, firms, and workers.  <br/>
<br/>

I am an affiliate of the [Latin American, Caribbean, and Iberian Studies Program]( https://lacis.wisc.edu/) and the [Elections Research Center](https://elections.wisc.edu/) at UW-Madison. My work has been funded by STEG-CEPR, the SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), the Institute for Regional and International Studies, Tinker Nave, and a UW Graduate Fellowship. Prior to my PhD, I was a Fulbright Research Fellow at [Unicamp](https://www.eco.unicamp.br/nea/) in Brazil. I received a BS in Economics from the University of Minnesota.
