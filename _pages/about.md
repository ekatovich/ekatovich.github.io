Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. <!-- You can read my CV [here](http://ekatovich.github.io/files/Katovich_CV.pdf). -->

My research lies in the fields of development economics, resource economics, and political economy. I combine big administrative datasets and apply econometric and geospatial tools to study institutions of natural resource governance, industrialization and industrial policies, and the effects of resource booms and busts on governments, firms, and workers.  <br/>

I am an affiliate of the [Latin American, Caribbean, and Iberian Studies Program]( https://lacis.wisc.edu/) and the [Elections Research Center](https://elections.wisc.edu/) at UW-Madison. My work has been funded by the SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), the Institute for Regional and International Studies, Tinker Nave, and a UW Graduate Fellowship. Prior to my PhD, I was a Fulbright Research Fellow at [Unicamp](https://www.eco.unicamp.br/nea/) in Brazil. I received a BS in Economics from the University of Minnesota.
