Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Institute of Economics and Econometrics at the University of Geneva. 
<br/>
<br/>

My research focuses on development, environmental and resource economics, and political economy. I use econometric and geospatial tools to study natural resource governance, structural transformation, and the effects of resource booms and energy transitions on governments, firms, and workers.  <br/>
<br/>

I earned a PhD in Agricultural and Applied Economics from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://aae.wisc.edu/) in 2022. Previously, I was a Fulbright Research Fellow at [Unicamp](https://www.eco.unicamp.br/nea/) in Brazil.
