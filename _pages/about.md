Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. You can download my CV [here](http://ekatovich.github.io/files/CV_2020_09_17.pdf).

Previously, I was a Fulbright Research Fellow at the Universidade Estadual de Campinas in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

My research lies in the fields of development economics, resource economics, and political economy. I am interested in institutions of natural resource governance, industrialization and industrial policies, and the effects of resource booms and busts on governments, firms, and workers. 

In my current work, I use applied econometrics, big data, and natural experiments to understand how local governments respond to oil discoveries, how an oil boom created spillovers across manufacturing sectors, and how corporate donations drive deforestation in the Amazon. <br/>

# **Selected Research Topics**

The "Presource Curse":  How do local governments react to the announcement of oil discoveries? What happens when expectations of oil riches are disappointed?
