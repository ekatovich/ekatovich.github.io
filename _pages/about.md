Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I will be joining the Institute of Economics and Econometrics at the University of Geneva as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Fall 2022. 
<br/>
<br/>

My research focuses on development, environmental and resource economics, and political economy. I use econometric and geospatial tools to study natural resource governance, structural transformation, and the effects of resource booms and energy transitions on governments, firms, and workers.  <br/>
<br/>

I am an affiliate of the [Latin American, Caribbean, and Iberian Studies Program]( https://lacis.wisc.edu/) and the [Elections Research Center](https://elections.wisc.edu/) at UW-Madison. Prior to my PhD, I was a Fulbright Research Fellow at [Unicamp](https://www.eco.unicamp.br/nea/) in Brazil. I received a BS in Economics from the University of Minnesota.
