Please feel free to make use of these resources, or reach out with questions, comments or suggestions through e-mail (ekatovich@wisc.edu) or [Github](https://github.com/ekatovich)! <br/>

[Crosswalk to create Minimum Comparable Areas for Brazilian Municipalities](https://sites.google.com/site/philippehrl/research) <br/> 
[Philipp Ehrl](https://sites.google.com/site/philippehrl/) has created Stata code to create "Minimum Comparable Areas" from Brazilian municipalities. These are coherent geographical units that take account of municipal splits and unions over different time periods.  <br/>
