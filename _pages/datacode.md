**Brazilian Data Resources**
I work with a wide range of administrative datasets from Brazil. I will post here useful data and cleaning scripts. Please feel free to make use of these resources, or reach out with questions, comments or suggestions through [e-mail] or [Github](https://github.com/ekatovich)!

**Useful Links**
[Cleaning RAIS in Stata (1985-2018)](https://github.com/rdahis/clean_RAIS)
[Ricardo Dahis](https://www.ricardodahis.com/) provides Stata code to clean the Relação Anual de Informações Sociais (RAIS), a matched employer-employee dataset with information on all formal establishments and workers in Brazil. 

[geobr spatial datasets in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geobr/vignettes/intro_to_geobr.html)
The geobr package in R offers an easy way to download official Brazilian shapefiles. 

[Crosswalk to create Minimum Comparable Areas for Brazilian Municipalities](https://sites.google.com/site/philippehrl/research)
[Philipp Ehrl](https://sites.google.com/site/philippehrl/) has created Stata code to create "Minimum Comparable Areas" from Brazilian municipalities. These are coherent geographical units that take account of municipal splits and unions over different time periods. 

[IPEA Data](http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/Default.aspx)
IPEA makes available a large number of macroeconomic, social, and regional panel datasets for Brazil, many at the municipal level.
